# EMRG

## Introduction

The project is a simple University Management System.

At completion, the system is expected to be able to support numerous things online.

## Getting Started

To test/run the system, on your machine, you must have [**.Net Core**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) **SDK** (2.2 or higher) installed on your machine. The runtime and application is cross-platform (i.e. supports Windows, Mac and Linux environments). Download the OS-specific version for your machine.

## Build and Test

Once you have the runtime installed and downloaded the source code, you are ready to go.

+ Check if your `dotnet` command is working. Open up the terminal and enter `dotnet --version`. You should see something like this: `2.2.103`.

+ On the project source folder, there is a scripts folder. You can run the `build.ps1` file (on Windows), or `build.sh` (on Linux/Mac) to build the solution. There is also a `run.ps1` / `run.sh` file that builds and runs the execuatable.
